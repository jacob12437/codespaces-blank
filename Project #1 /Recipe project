        <h5>CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE RECIPE</h5>
        <h6><font size="+3"Ingredients</font></font></h6>
        <ul> Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</ul> 
        <ul> Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</ul>
        <ul>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</ul>
        <ul>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</ul>
        <ul> Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</ul>
        <ul>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</ul>
        <ul>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</ul>
        <ul>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</ul>
        <h7>Instructions</h6></h9>
        <ol>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</ol>
        <ol>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</ol>
        <ol>Stir in the flour and chocolate chips,</ol>
        <ol>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</ol>
        <ol>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</ol>
